My solutions for different leetcode problems
Since I really shouldn't be uploading all of my coding from solar car, and I still need to find my code from older projects, this repository exists to demonstrate my coding knowledge.
Currently only doing the problems in Java as I want to brush up on the language after doing so much Python, but I will eventually transition into C++. 
Or I'll just spin a wheel to decide which language to work in for a day.

on 6.11.24, a coworker recommended I try the leetcode 75 so going forward I plan to do the daily problem if I find it interesting, and to just get the 75 done.
I made a separate folder for my solutions to these to help with organization, I wish I could do something like tag the files so it would be possible to sort by them but it's not really that big of a deal.
