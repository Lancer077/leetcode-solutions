Daily problem 2/13/25

Data structures with names starting with "H" ü§ù being absolutely legendary when it comes to solving hard coding problems
Heaps are one of those structures that I ignore probably more than I should, but today I found them to be incredibly helpful
This one took a couple of tries but overall the final code was super simple
Almost halfway done with February!!!
