My solutions for different leetcode problems
Since I really shouldn't be uploading all of my coding from solar car, and I still need to find my code from older projects, this repository exists to demonstrate my coding knowledge.
Currently only doing the problems in Java as I want to brush up on the language after doing so much Python, but I will eventually transition into C++. 
Or I'll just spin a wheel to decide which language to work in for a day.
